🏏 Built an IPL Win Predictor Web App
Applied Machine Learning, Streamlit and Joblib
📌 Here's how it worked:
⚫ Loaded, analyzed, and preprocessed Indian Premier League match data in Google Colab.
⚫ Applied ML regression algorithms—including Decision Tree, Random Forest, Linear Regression, Lasso, SVM, and Neural Networks—to predict match outcomes ---Random forest worked the best.
⚫ Serialized the trained Random Forest model using Python’s Joblib module for reuse in predictions. (used Pickle last time)
⚫ Developed the web app in VSCode using Streamlit framework (had used Flask last time).
⚫ Designed an interactive frontend allowing users to select batting/bowling teams, venue, target, present score, overs done and wickets lost.
⚫ Ran the app locally via terminal and Streamlit server.
⚫ Performed trial runs to get dynamic win probability predictions for IPL teams.
This exercise reinforced my understanding of feature engineering, model training, deployment, and integrating Python ML models with interactive web apps.
